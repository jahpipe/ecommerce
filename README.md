## Progress Summary (As of 2025-08-09)

### Backend

  - **Registration** and **Login** endpoints
  - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to differentiate user roles (e.g., admin, customer)
  - **Access Token** and **Refresh Token** handling using JWT for secure sessions
  - Input validation using **Zod** schemas to ensure data integrity and type safety

### Frontend

- Created a **responsive landing page** for the ecommerce site using React
- Integrated login and registration UI to interact with backend authentication API
- Set up project structure to support future ecommerce features (products, cart, checkout)
